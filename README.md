Hey coaches and managers,
After way too many games of scribbling on a crumpled paper and arguing about who sat last inning, I finally built something that actually helps.
I call it Lineup Manager — a simple, free web app that runs on your phone or laptop and handles the two things that stress us out most on game day:

Why this actually helps

Creates a fair bench rotation automatically (no player sits twice until everyone has sat once, and no back-to-back benches)
Forces the exact number of bench players you need (10 players = 1 bench, 11 = 2 benches, 12 = 3 benches, etc.)
Only lets players play positions they’re actually tagged for on the roster
Produces a clean, professional one-page printable lineup card with your team logos, batting order, and defensive positions filled in
All data syncs between pages — mark who’s available once and it carries over everywhere

How I use it:

Roster & Stats – Set your roster and import stats from GameChanger.
Available Players Today – Check off who showed up (this feeds everything else).
Defense Rotation Planner – Fill in pitcher, catcher, and field positions inning by inning. The bench dropdown is smart — it hides players that have already sat the bench until all players have sat at least once.
Create Lineup – Auto-fill batting order using your season stats (or manual), then hit the save button.
Printable Game Day Card – One clean page with logos, batting order (with positions filled), and season stats. Download as HTML and print or open on your phone.

Runs in any browser — I added it to my iPhone home screen and it feels like a real app.
All your data stays private (runs on Streamlit Cloud, or you can run it locally).
No cost, no ads, no account needed.

Would love feedback from other coaches — especially if you have ideas for new features (opponent scouting, pitch count tracker, etc.).
If this saves even one coach from the usual chaos on a Saturday morning, I’ll consider it a win.
